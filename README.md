# STM32F4-Discovery-Minimal_HAL
A minimal project for HAL projects on the STM32F4 Discovery Board. No configuration is provided other than the automatically generated initialisation by the Cube IDE.

## Using the Minimal Project
Download/Fork the project.

Edit the `main.c` file, found in "Core" -> "Src", to perform the required activities during a tutorial which allows the use of HAL.

This project omits many additional comments which are triggered by the code generation of STM32CubeIDE, providing a minimal template to be populated by the developer.

### Note
In a real world use case, many files from this example would have been omitted using a .gitignore file. To locate the main source file, navigate to "Core"->"Src"->"main.c".
